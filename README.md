# Ralph

> **Note:** This project is an experiment in agentic coding. It is intended for
> experimental and personal use only.

An autonomous coding agent loop. Ralph takes a feature description, breaks it
into right-sized user stories, and implements them one by one -- running quality
checks and committing after each step -- until the feature is done.

You work from your terminal. Ralph works in an isolated workspace.

This repository also contains **[AutoRalph](docs/autoralph.md)** -- an
autonomous daemon that watches Linear for assigned issues and drives them
through a complete development lifecycle (refine, plan, build, open PR, address
review feedback) using Ralph under the hood.

## How It Works

```
            You                                Ralph
            ───                                ─────
  1. Create a workspace           git worktree + branch created
  2. Describe your feature        Interactive Claude conversation
  3. Type /finish                  Structured PRD generated (stories + tests)
  4. ralph run                     Autonomous loop starts:
                                     ┌─ Pick next unfinished story
                                     │  Implement + write tests
                                     │  Run quality checks
                                     │  Commit
                                     │  Mark story as passing
                                     └─ Repeat until all stories done
                                   QA phase:
                                     ┌─ Run integration tests from PRD
                                     │  Fix any failures
                                     └─ Repeat until all tests pass
  5. ralph done                    Squash-merge into main, clean up
```

### The Loop in Detail

For each iteration, Ralph:

1. Reads the PRD and finds the next unfinished story
2. Invokes Claude with the story context, acceptance criteria, and project patterns
3. Claude implements the story, writes tests, and runs quality checks
4. On success, Claude commits and marks the story as passing in the PRD
5. Appends a progress entry to the shared progress log

When all stories pass, Ralph enters the **QA phase**:

1. A QA agent reads the integration test specs from the PRD
2. It builds and runs automated tests for each spec
3. If tests fail, a QA fix agent resolves the issues
4. The cycle continues until all integration tests pass

---

## Typical Workflow

Here is the normal flow from start to finish:

```
 ┌──────────────────┐
 │   ralph init     │  One-time project setup
 └────────┬─────────┘
          │
          ▼
 ┌──────────────────┐
 │   ralph new      │  Create workspace for a feature
 │   feature-name   │  (creates branch, worktree, cd's in,
 │                  │   launches PRD creation automatically)
 │                  │
 │  ... chat ...    │  Discuss feature with Claude
 │  /finish         │  Claude writes structured PRD
 └────────┬─────────┘
          │
          ▼
 ┌──────────────────┐
 │   ralph run      │  Autonomous loop

 └──────────────────┘
```

### Working on Multiple Features

Ralph supports multiple workspaces simultaneously. Each workspace is fully
isolated with its own branch, PRD, and working directory:

```bash
ralph new login-page         # Start feature A (PRD created interactively)
# ... /finish, then:
ralph run                    # Run the loop

ralph new dark-mode          # Start feature B (parallel)
# ... /finish, then:
ralph run                    # Run the loop

ralph switch login-page      # Jump back to feature A
ralph overview               # See progress across all workspaces
```

---

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.25+** (build from source)
- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** (`claude` CLI) installed and authenticated
- **git** (for worktree operations)
- **bash** or **zsh** (for shell integration)

---

## Installation

### Ralph

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uesteibar/ralph/main/install-ralph.sh | sh
```

Or install from source:

```bash
go install github.com/uesteibar/ralph/cmd/ralph@latest
```

Or clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uesteibar/ralph.git
cd ralph
just install    # requires https://github.com/casey/just
```

### AutoRalph

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uesteibar/ralph/main/install-autoralph.sh | sh
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uesteibar/ralph.git
cd ralph
just web-build    # Build the React dashboard
just autoralph    # Build the Go binary
```

See [AutoRalph documentation](docs/autoralph.md) for configuration and usage.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd ~/code/my-project

# 2. Initialize Ralph (creates .ralph/ directory and config)
ralph init

# 3. Set up shell integration (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(ralph shell-init)"

# 4. Review and edit the generated config
$EDITOR .ralph/ralph.yaml

# 5. Create a workspace and start building
ralph new login-page
#    └─ Creates workspace, cd's into it, starts PRD session with Claude

# 6. Discuss the feature with Claude, then type /finish

# 7. Run the autonomous loop
ralph run

# 8. When done, squash-merge and clean up
ralph done
```

---

## Shell Integration

Ralph requires a thin shell wrapper for workspace switching. It lets commands
like `ralph new`, `ralph switch`, and `ralph done` change your working directory
and track the current workspace via the `RALPH_WORKSPACE` environment variable.

Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(ralph shell-init)"
```

**What it does:**

- Wraps the `ralph` binary in a shell function
- Intercepts workspace commands (`new`, `switch`, `done`, `workspaces *`) to
  automatically `cd` into the correct directory
- Sets/unsets `RALPH_WORKSPACE` to track the active workspace
- After `ralph new`, automatically starts an interactive PRD creation session
  if no PRD exists yet
- All other commands pass through to the binary unchanged

Currently supports **bash** and **zsh**.

**Tip:** You can embed workspace status in your shell prompt:

```bash
PS1='$(ralph status --short 2>/dev/null) $ '
# Shows: "login-page 3/5 $ " or "base $ "
```

---

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is an isolated environment for a single feature. Each workspace
gets:

- Its own **git worktree** (a separate checkout of the repo on a dedicated branch)
- Its own **PRD** (the requirements document that drives the loop)
- A copy of **`.ralph/`** and **`.claude/`** so the agent has full context
- Any extra files you specify in `copy_to_worktree` config

```
your-project/
  .ralph/
    ralph.yaml                  # project config (committed)
    progress.txt                # shared progress log (committed)
    workspaces/                 # gitignored
      login-page/
        workspace.json          # metadata (name, branch, createdAt)
        prd.json                # this workspace's PRD
        tree/                   # the git worktree (your code)
      dark-mode/
        workspace.json
        prd.json
        tree/
    state/                      # gitignored
      workspaces.json           # registry of all workspaces
      archive/                  # PRDs from completed features
```

### Why Workspaces?

| Benefit | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Isolation** | Each feature is on its own branch with its own worktree -- no conflicts between parallel work |
| **Context tracking** | Shell integration knows which workspace you're in; commands automatically use the right branch and PRD |
| **Easy switching** | `ralph switch` jumps between features instantly |
| **Clean merges** | `ralph done` squash-merges everything into one commit on main |
| **Parallel agents** | You can run `ralph run` in multiple workspaces simultaneously |

### Base Mode

You can also run commands without a workspace (in **base** mode). This uses the
main repo directory and stores the PRD at `.ralph/state/prd.json`. Workspaces
are recommended for any non-trivial work, but base mode is useful for quick
experiments or when you just want `ralph chat`.

---

## Commands

### `ralph init`

One-time project setup. Scaffolds the `.ralph/` directory. Idempotent -- safe
to run multiple times.

```bash
ralph init
```

**Interactive prompts:**

1. **Git tracking choice:**
   - *Track in git* (recommended for teams) -- gitignores only ephemeral dirs
   - *Keep local* -- gitignores the entire `.ralph/` directory
2. **LLM analysis:** optionally uses Claude to auto-detect quality check commands
   for your project (test runners, linters, type checkers, etc.)

**What it creates:**

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.ralph/ralph.yaml` | Project configuration (edit this!) |
| `.ralph/progress.txt` | Shared progress log across features |
| `.ralph/tasks/` | Task markdown files |
| `.ralph/skills/` | Project-specific skills for the agent |
| `.ralph/workspaces/` | Workspace directories (gitignored) |
| `.ralph/state/workspaces.json` | Workspace registry (gitignored) |
| `.ralph/state/archive/` | Completed PRDs (gitignored) |
| `.claude/commands/finish.md` | The `/finish` skill for PRD generation |
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Project rules for the agent |

---

### `ralph new`

Creates a new workspace with an isolated git worktree and branch. Alias for
`ralph workspaces new`.

```bash
ralph new login-page
ralph new dark-mode
```

The branch name is derived from the config prefix + workspace name
(e.g., `ralph/login-page`). After creation, your shell `cd`s into the
workspace's `tree/` directory and launches an interactive PRD creation session
with Claude if no PRD exists yet.

**During PRD creation:**

1. You describe the feature you want to build
2. Claude asks clarifying questions about scope, requirements, edge cases
3. You discuss and refine until the plan is solid
4. Once you agree on user stories and integration tests, type **`/finish`**
5. Claude writes a structured PRD JSON file with:
   - User stories (ordered by dependency, right-sized for one iteration each)
   - Integration tests (end-to-end verification specs)

After `/finish`, the PRD is ready and you can run `ralph run`.

If the branch already exists (e.g., from a previous attempt), Ralph asks
whether to start **fresh** (delete old branch) or **resume** (reuse it).

Requires [shell integration](#shell-integration).

---

### `ralph run`

Runs the autonomous execution loop. This is the core of Ralph -- it implements
your feature story by story.

```bash
ralph run
ralph run --max-iterations 10
ralph run --workspace login-page
ralph run --no-tui
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |
| `--max-iterations` | `20` | Maximum loop iterations |
| `--workspace` | auto-detect | Workspace name |
| `--no-tui` | `false` | Disable TUI, use plain-text output |

By default, `ralph run` opens an interactive [TUI](#tui-terminal-ui) showing
a sidebar with story progress and a scrollable agent log. Use `--no-tui` for
plain-text output (useful for CI or piping).

When all stories and integration tests pass, Ralph exits and suggests
`ralph done`.

---

### `ralph chat`

Opens a free-form interactive Claude session with full project context.
Use it for ad-hoc tasks, debugging, or manual adjustments within a workspace.

```bash
ralph chat
ralph chat --continue
ralph chat --workspace login-page
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |
| `--workspace` | auto-detect | Workspace name |
| `--continue` | `false` | Resume the most recent conversation |

Claude receives context about your project config, progress log, recent commits,
and the current PRD (if one exists).

---

### `ralph status`

Shows the current workspace and story/test progress.

```bash
ralph status
ralph status --short
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |
| `--short` | `false` | Single-line output for shell prompts |

**Full output:**

```
Workspace: login-page
Branch: ralph/login-page
Stories: 3/5 passing
Tests: 1/2 passing
```

**Short output** (`--short`): `login-page 3/5` or `base`

---

### `ralph overview`

Shows progress across all workspaces at a glance.

```bash
ralph overview
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |

**Example output:**

```
  base  main
* login-page  ralph/login-page  Stories: 3/5  Tests: 0/1  [current]
  dark-mode   ralph/dark-mode   Stories: 5/5  Tests: 2/2
  payments    ralph/payments    (no prd)
```

---

### `ralph rebase`

Rebases the workspace branch onto the latest base branch. If conflicts occur,
Claude is invoked to resolve them using PRD context.

```bash
ralph rebase
ralph rebase develop
ralph rebase --workspace login-page
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |
| `--workspace` | auto-detect | Workspace name |

The optional positional argument specifies the target branch (defaults to
`repo.default_base` from config).

Requires workspace context (not base).

---

### `ralph done`

Squash-merges the workspace branch into the base branch, archives the PRD,
and removes the workspace.

```bash
ralph done
ralph done --workspace login-page
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |
| `--workspace` | auto-detect | Workspace name |

**What it does:**

1. Verifies the base branch is an ancestor (prompts to rebase if not)
2. Generates a commit message from the PRD (description + completed stories)
3. Lets you edit the message before committing
4. Squash-merges into the base branch
5. Archives the PRD to `.ralph/state/archive/`
6. Removes the workspace (worktree, branch, registry entry)
7. Returns you to the base repo directory

Requires [shell integration](#shell-integration).

---

### `ralph switch`

Switches between workspaces. With no argument, shows an interactive picker.
With a name, switches directly.

```bash
ralph switch              # interactive picker
ralph switch login-page   # switch directly
ralph switch base         # back to main repo
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |

Requires [shell integration](#shell-integration).

---

### `ralph workspaces`

Workspace management subcommands:

```bash
ralph workspaces new <name>       # Create a workspace (same as `ralph new`)
ralph workspaces list             # List all workspaces
ralph workspaces switch <name>    # Switch to a workspace
ralph workspaces remove <name>    # Remove a workspace
ralph workspaces prune            # Remove all completed workspaces
```

**`ralph workspaces prune`** identifies workspaces where all stories and
integration tests pass (or the PRD is missing), prompts for confirmation,
and removes them in bulk.

---

### `ralph eject`

Exports all embedded prompt templates to `.ralph/prompts/` so you can
customize them.

```bash
ralph eject
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |

After ejecting, Ralph uses your local copies instead of the built-in templates.
Edit them to change how the agent behaves -- the loop iteration prompt, QA
prompts, PRD creation prompt, chat system prompt, and rebase conflict prompt.

To re-eject (e.g., after upgrading Ralph), delete `.ralph/prompts/` and run
`ralph eject` again.

See [Prompt Customization](#prompt-customization) for details.

---

### `ralph validate`

Validates the project configuration and reports issues.

```bash
ralph validate
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--project-config` | auto-discover | Path to project config YAML |

Checks required fields (`project`, `repo.default_base`), validates regex
patterns, and warns about missing quality checks.

---

## TUI (Terminal UI)

When you run `ralph run`, it opens a full-screen terminal UI:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Stories                    │  Agent Log                               │

```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Switch focus between sidebar and agent log |
| `↑` / `k` | Navigate up (sidebar items or scroll log) |
| `↓` / `j` | Navigate down (sidebar items or scroll log) |
| `Enter` | Open detail overlay for selected story/test |
| `Esc` | Close overlay |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` | Graceful stop (finishes current task, then exits) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Immediate stop |

### Sidebar

Shows all user stories and integration tests from the PRD with live status
indicators (✓ pass, ✗ fail). The currently active story is highlighted.
Refreshes automatically as the agent updates the PRD.

### Detail Overlay

Press `Enter` on a sidebar item to see full details: description, acceptance
criteria (stories) or steps (tests), status, failure messages, and notes.

### Plain-Text Mode

Use `--no-tui` for simple text output to stderr. Useful for logging,
CI pipelines, or when your terminal doesn't support the TUI:

```bash
ralph run --no-tui
```

---

## Configuration

Ralph is configured per-project via `.ralph/ralph.yaml`. It is created by
`ralph init` and can be edited at any time.

### Config Discovery

When `--project-config` is not provided, Ralph walks up from the current
working directory looking for `.ralph/ralph.yaml`. This means you can run
commands from any subdirectory (or from inside a workspace tree).

### Full Config Reference

```yaml
# Human-readable project name (required)
project: MyProject

repo:
  # Base branch for merges (required)
  default_base: main

  # Prefix prepended to workspace names to form branch names
  # e.g., "ralph/" + "login-page" = "ralph/login-page"
  branch_prefix: "ralph/"       # default: "ralph/"

  # Regex that generated branch names must match (optional)
  branch_pattern: "^ralph/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$"

# Directory paths relative to repo root
paths:
  tasks_dir: ".ralph/tasks"
  skills_dir: ".ralph/skills"

# Commands that must pass before the agent commits
# Each runs via sh -c in the workspace working directory
quality_checks:
  - "npm test"
  - "npm run lint"
  - "npm run typecheck"

# Files/patterns to copy from repo root into workspace worktrees (optional)
# Supports literal paths, wildcards (*), and recursive globs (**)
copy_to_worktree:
  - ".env"
  - "scripts/**"
  - "fixtures/*.json"
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `project` | Project name |
| `repo.default_base` | Base branch (e.g., `main`, `develop`) |

All other fields are optional with sensible defaults.

### `copy_to_worktree`

When creating a workspace, Ralph already copies `.ralph/` and `.claude/`
automatically. Use `copy_to_worktree` for additional files the agent might need
that aren't committed to git (e.g., `.env` files) or that live outside those
directories.

Supports:
- Literal paths: `scripts/setup.sh`
- Single-level wildcards: `configs/*.json`
- Recursive globs: `fixtures/**/*.txt`
- Directories: `data/` (copied recursively)

---

## PRD Format

The PRD (Product Requirements Document) is a JSON file that drives the
execution loop. It is generated by typing `/finish` during the PRD creation
session (launched by `ralph new`) and updated by the agent during `ralph run`.

```json
{
  "project": "MyProject",
  "branchName": "ralph/login-page",
  "description": "Add user login with email and password",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Add user schema and migration",
      "description": "Create the users table with email, password_hash, created_at",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Migration creates users table with correct columns",
        "Model validates email format",
        "All quality checks pass"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    },
    {
      "id": "US-002",
      "title": "Add login API endpoint",
      "description": "POST /api/login that authenticates and returns a session token",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Returns 200 with token for valid credentials",
        "Returns 401 for invalid credentials",
        "All quality checks pass"
      ],
      "priority": 2,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""

### User Stories

Each story represents one iteration of the loop -- it should be completable in
a single Claude context window. Stories are executed in `priority` order (lowest
first).

**Right-sized stories:**

- Add a database table and migration
- Add an API endpoint with tests
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update validation logic

**Too large (split into multiple):**

- Build the entire authentication system
- Redesign the settings page

Stories are ordered by dependency: schema first, then backend, then UI.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are end-to-end verification specs agreed upon during PRD
creation. After all stories pass, the QA agent builds automated tests matching
these specs and verifies the feature works as a whole.

### Fields Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `userStories[].id` | string | Story identifier (e.g., `US-001`) |
| `userStories[].passes` | bool | Set to `true` by the agent when complete |
| `userStories[].notes` | string | Agent notes (patterns learned, decisions made) |
| `integrationTests[].id` | string | Test identifier (e.g., `IT-001`) |
| `integrationTests[].passes` | bool | Set to `true` by QA agent when verified |
| `integrationTests[].failure` | string | Failure details if test didn't pass |
| `integrationTests[].notes` | string | QA agent notes |

## Prompt Customization

Ralph's agent behavior is driven by prompt templates compiled into the binary.
You can customize them by ejecting:

```bash
ralph eject
```

This creates `.ralph/prompts/` with all templates:

| Template | Used by | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `loop_iteration.md` | `ralph run` | Main prompt for implementing a single story |
| `qa_verification.md` | `ralph run` | QA agent prompt for integration test verification |
| `qa_fix.md` | `ralph run` | QA fix agent prompt for resolving test failures |
| `prd_new.md` | `ralph new` | Interactive PRD creation conversation |
| `chat_system.md` | `ralph chat` | System prompt for free-form chat sessions |
| `rebase_conflict.md` | `ralph rebase` | Conflict resolution prompt |

When `.ralph/prompts/` exists, Ralph loads templates from there instead of the
built-in versions. You can override individual templates -- any missing files
fall back to the embedded defaults.

Templates use Go's `text/template` syntax with `{{ .FieldName }}` placeholders.

## AutoRalph

AutoRalph is an autonomous daemon that watches Linear for assigned issues and
drives them through a complete lifecycle without human intervention:

```
Linear issue assigned  -->  AI refinement  -->  User approves plan
  -->  Workspace created  -->  Ralph builds feature  -->  PR opened
  -->  Review feedback addressed  -->  PR merged  -->  Done
```

It includes a **web dashboard** at `http://127.0.0.1:7749` with real-time
status, a REST API, and WebSocket updates.

**Full documentation**: [docs/autoralph.md](docs/autoralph.md)

**Quick start**:

```bash
# 1. Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uesteibar/ralph/main/install-autoralph.sh | sh

# 2. Configure credentials (token or GitHub App — see docs/autoralph.md)
mkdir -p ~/.autoralph
cat > ~/.autoralph/credentials.yaml << 'EOF'
default_profile: default
profiles:
  default:
    linear_api_key: lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
    github_token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx          # or use github_app_* fields
EOF

# 3. Configure a project
mkdir -p ~/.autoralph/projects
cat > ~/.autoralph/projects/my-project.yaml << 'EOF'
name: my-project
local_path: ~/code/my-project
github:
  owner: myorg
  repo: my-project
linear:
  team_id: "your-team-uuid"
  assignee_id: "your-user-uuid"
EOF

# 4. Run
autoralph serve
```

### Design Decisions

- **Minimal dependencies**: `yaml.v3` for config, `lipgloss`/`bubbletea`/`huh`
  for terminal UI, `doublestar` for glob patterns. Everything else is stdlib.
- **Shell out to CLIs**: `git` and `claude` are invoked as subprocesses. No API
  client libraries.
- **Prompts compiled into binary**: Markdown templates are embedded via
  `go:embed`. No external files needed at runtime (unless
  [ejected](#prompt-customization)).
- **Workspace isolation**: Each feature runs in a separate git worktree,
  keeping the main branch clean and enabling parallel agents.
- **Event-driven output**: The loop emits events (`ToolUse`, `StoryStarted`,
  `IterationStart`, etc.) consumed by either the TUI or a plain-text handler.
